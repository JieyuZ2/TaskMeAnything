## What's TaskMeAnything?
TaskMeAnything is a benchmark generation engine which produces a benchmark for large multimodal language models (MLMs) tailored to a user's needs. 
In particular, name maintains an extendable taxonomy of visual assets and can programmatically generate a vast number of task instances. 
Additionally, it algorithmically addresses user queries regarding MLM performance efficiently within a computational budget. 
The current version can generate >500M image/video question-answering pairs, which focus on evaluating MLM perceptual capabilities.


We release the following resources: 
1. [**TaskMeAnything-v1**](https://github.com/JieyuZ2/TaskMeAnything): the first version of TaskMeAnything, includes 28 task generators which can generate over 500M VQA task.
2. **TaskMeAnything-v1-Random**[[ImageQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weikaih/TaskMeAnything-v1-imageqa-random)|[VideoQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weikaih/TaskMeAnything-v1-videoqa-random)]: A randomly selected from TaskMeAnything-v1, including 5,700 ImageQA and 1,800 VideoQA task instances.
3. [**TaskMeAnything-DB**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weikaih/TaskMeAnything-v1-eval-db): A database for TaskMeAnything, which stores the evaluation results of 13 open-source MLMs over 1M VQA task instances.
4. [**TaskMeAnything-UI**](): An interactive graphical interface built upon TaskMeAnything-DB, which allows users to interact with the performance of models on TaskMeAnything-v1 in a intuitve way.

   

## TaskMeAnything-v1

### Installation
You can easily download the repo and set up the environments via:
```
git clone https://github.com/JieyuZ2/TaskMeAnything.git
cd ./TaskMeAnything

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notice: if you want to render 3D images/videos by `Blender` locally or use `Internvl-chat-v1.5-24B` that required `flash-attn` which hard to install by pip, you can use the docker image we provide. 
You can pull the docker image from DockerHub which includes all the dependencies like `Blender`, `flash-attn`, `cuda driver`, `nvcc`, etc.
```
docker push weikaih/ubuntu20.4_internvl_blender_v1.2:latest
docker run --gpus all -it weikaih/ubuntu20.4_internvl_blender_v1.2:latest /bin/bash # run the docker image with GPU support

git clone https://github.com/JieyuZ2/TaskMeAnything.git
cd ./TaskMeAnything

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Source data
Source data is stored in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jieyuz2/TaskMeAnything-v1-source). It includes `3d_assets`, `agqa_video`, and `object_images`.

For real image with scene graphs, please download the images and scene graphs from the following links: [SceneGraph](https://downloads.cs.stanford.edu/nlp/data/gqa/sceneGraphs.zip), [Image](https://downloads.cs.stanford.edu/nlp/data/gqa/images.zip). 
After downloading, move the scene graphs and images into the source data folder, and arrange them as format below.
```
TaskMeAnything-v1-source/vg/sceneGraphs: move scene graphs files to this folder (e.g. TaskMeAnything-v1-source/vg/sceneGraphs/train_sceneGraphs.json).
TaskMeAnything-v1-source/vg/images/images: move all the images to this folder (e.g. TaskMeAnything-v1-source/vg/images/images/2323739.jpg).
```


### Task Generator
We have 28 task generators in TaskMeAnything-v1, across 5 Scenarios:
1. `2D Sticker Image`: grid-how-many, grid-what, grid-where, grid-what-attribute, grid-where-attribute
2. `3D Tabletop Image`: 3d-what, 3d-where, 3d-what-attribute, 3d-where-attribute, 3d-how-many, 3d-what-size, 3d-where-size, 3d-what-attribute-size, 3d-what-distance, 3d-where-distance, 3d-what-attribute-distance
3. `3D Tabletop Video`: video-3d-what-move, video-3d-where-move, video-3d-what-attribute-move, video-3d-what-rotate, video-3d-where-rotate, video-3d-what-attribute-rotate
4. `Real Images`: sg-what-object, sg-what-relation, sg-what-attribute
5. `Real Videos`: video-sg-what-object, video-sg-what-relation, video-sg-what-action

### Tested Models 
We support the following ImageQA and VideoQA models: 
- `ImageQA`: qwenvl-chat, qwenvl, llavav1.5-7b, llavav1.5-13b, instructblip-vicuna7b, instructblip-vicuna13b, internvl-chat-v1.5, gemini-vision-pro, qwen-vl-max, gpt4v, gpt4o
- `VideoQA`: video-llama2-7b, video-llama2-13b, video-llava-7b, chat-univi-7b, chat-univi-13b, video-chatgpt-7b, video-chat2-7b
### Demo
Stay tuned! We will release the demo soon.

## TaskMeAnything-v1-Random
[TaskMeAnything-v1-imageqa-random](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weikaih/TaskMeAnything-v1-imageqa-random) is a dataset randomly selected from TaskMeAnything-v1, including 5,700 ImageQA.

[TaskMeAnything-v1-videoqa-random](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weikaih/TaskMeAnything-v1-videoqa-random) is a dataset randomly selected from TaskMeAnything-v1, including 1,800 VideoQA questions.

### Load TaskMeAnything-v1-Random ImageQA Dataset
```
import datasets

dataset_name = 'weikaih/TaskMeAnything-v1-imageqa-random'
dataset = datasets.load_dataset(dataset_name, split = TASK_GENERATOR_SPLIT)
```
where `TASK_GENERATOR_SPLIT` is one of the task generators, eg, `2d_how_many`.


### Load TaskMeAnything-v1-Random VideoQA Dataset and Convert Video Binary Stream to mp4
* Since Huggingface does not support saving .mp4 files in datasets, we save videos in the format of binary streams. After loading, you can convert the video binary stream to .mp4 using the following method.
```
import datasets

dataset_name = 'weikaih/TaskMeAnything-v1-videoqa-random'
dataset = datasets.load_dataset(dataset_name, split = TASK_GENERATOR_SPLIT)

# example: convert binary stream in dataset to .mp4 files
video_binary = dataset[0]['video']
with open('/path/save/video.mp4', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(video_binary)
```

## TaskMeAnything-DB
**TaskMeAnything-DB** are stored in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jieyuz2/TaskMeAnything-v1-db)

## TaskMeAnything-UI
**TaskMeAnything-UI** are hosted in [HuggingFace](todo), check out our interactive interface to explore the performance of models on TaskMeAnything-v1 in your own way!
